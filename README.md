# Scalable Ticket Management Solution

A high-performance, cost-optimized ticket booking system designed to handle massive concurrent traffic during concert releases. Built with serverless architecture and modern cloud-native patterns. Inspired by ticketmaster

## What is the problem?

Traditional ticket booking systems face critical challenges during high-demand events:

- **High Concurrency**: Thousands of users competing for limited tickets simultaneously
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple users attempting to purchase the same seat at the same time
- **Cost Optimization**: Need to scale efficiently without over-provisioning as a lot of people is using the system
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times during peak traffic

## Architecture Overview

### Core Architecture Principles

- **Serverless-First**: Auto-scaling Lambda functions for unpredictable traffic patterns
- **Event-Driven**: EventBridge for orchestration and Lambda warming
- **Cache-Heavy**: Redis/ElastiCache for temporary seat reservations
- **Database Optimization**: DynamoDB for single-key lookups and to aid for massive scale
- **Idempotency**: Ensuring safe retries and preventing duplicate purchases

## Key Features

### User Journey

1. **Authentication**: Secure login/signup with JWT tokens
2. **Concert Selection**: Browse and filter available concerts
3. **Seat Selection**: Real-time seat availability fetched from Redis - users can only click available seats
4. **Checkout Process**: Stripe payment processing with seat reservation
5. **Account Management**: View purchased tickets and booking history

### Concurrency Solutions

- **Seat Reservation System**: 5-minute TTL in Redis for checkout process
- **Exponential Backoff**: Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- **State Machine**: Orchestrated workflow for ticket purchase lifecycle
- **Idempotency Keys**: Prevent duplicate transactions
- **Lambda Warming**: Pre-provisioned capacity for known high-traffic events

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Query** for state management and caching

### Backend

- **NestJS** with TypeScript
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless functions
- **API Gateway** for request routing and rate limiting
- **EventBridge** for event orchestration

### Database & Caching

- **DynamoDB** for persistent data storage
- **ElastiCache (Redis)** for temporary seat reservations and real-time seat availability
- **Local Development**: MongoDB/Redis for development (NoSQL to match production)

### Infrastructure

- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code
- **Docker** for local development
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline

### AWS Services

- **Lambda**: Serverless compute
- **API Gateway**: API management
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database
- **ElastiCache**: Redis caching
- **EventBridge**: Event routing and warming up of lambdas
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
- **CloudFront**: CDN for global distribution

## Concurrency Handling Strategy

### Seat Reservation Flow

```
1. User views seats → Fetch availability from Redis (real-time)
2. User clicks available seat → Reserve in Redis (5min TTL)
3. User proceeds to checkout → Validate reservation
4. Stripe payment success → Move from Redis to DynamoDB
5. Payment failure/timeout → Release reservation
```

### Data Consistency Strategy

- **Eventual Consistency**: Redis serves as the source of truth for seat availability
- **Strong Consistency**: DynamoDB conditional writes ensure no double-booking
- **Sync Mechanism**: Background jobs sync Redis with DynamoDB changes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with timestamp-based versioning

### Race Condition Prevention

- **Optimistic Locking**: Version fields in DynamoDB
- **Atomic Operations**: Conditional writes with existence checks
- **Distributed Locks**: Redis-based locking mechanism
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy

- **Redis Cache**: Real-time seat availability and temporary reservations
- **Lambda Memory**: In-memory caching for concert metadata and static data
- **DynamoDB**: Persistent storage with eventual consistency sync to Redis

### Scaling Patterns

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scaling Lambda functions
- **Vertical Scaling**: Provisioned capacity for known events
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-region deployment
- **CDN**: CloudFront for static assets

### Cost Optimization

- **Pay-per-request**: DynamoDB on-demand billing
- **Spot Instances**: For non-critical workloads
- **Reserved Capacity**: For predictable traffic patterns
- **Auto-scaling**: Right-size resources based on demand

## Thoughts and Reflections

After researching how ticketmaster handle extreme traffic, i discovered that Ticketmaster likely uses Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare virtual waiting rooms to manage massive concurrent demand. While this current proposed solution provides a solid foundation for handling high concurrency, it may still face challenges during unprecedented events like Taylor Swift concerts where demand can exceed millions of concurrent users. However, its a good start and there is room for improvement.

**Key Limitations Identified:**

- **Scale Ceiling**: Even with auto-scaling Lambda functions, AWS has concurrency limits
- **Cold Start Latency**: Lambda cold starts could impact user experience during traffic spikes
- **Redis Bottleneck**: Single Redis instance could become a bottleneck at extreme scale
